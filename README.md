**Rethinking window management for GNOME Shell**

A GNOME Shell extension that provides automatic window tiling in a mosaic layout. Inspired by [GNOME's vision for rethinking window management](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2023/07/26/rethinking-window-management/), Mosaic WM intelligently arranges windows to maximize screen space while maintaining visual harmony.

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental Extension**: This extension is under active development and may contain bugs or unexpected behavior. Use at your own risk. Please report any issues.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires GNOME Shell 50+ (Mutter 50). See [this post](https://floss.social/@CleoMenezesJr/116259051479532655) for details.

## Philosophy

Traditional window management forces users to manually position and resize windows. Mosaic WM takes a different approach:

- **Automatic**: Windows organize themselves intelligently
- **Adaptive**: Layout responds to your workflow
- **Minimal**: No manual tiling or complex keyboard shortcuts needed
- **Visual**: See your workspace at a glance

This aligns with GNOME's philosophy of reducing cognitive load and letting users focus on their work, not window management.

## Features

### Core Tiling
- **Automatic Mosaic Layout**: Windows are automatically arranged in an optimal layout using a radial packing algorithm
- **Smart Resize**: Before moving windows to new workspaces, the extension tries to resize existing windows to make space
- **Edge Tiling (Snap Zones)**: Drag windows to screen edges for half/quarter tiling - remaining windows adapt to the available space
- **Window Swapping**: Drag a window onto another to swap their positions

### Miniature Windows
- **Miniature Overflow**: When too many windows share a workspace, the oldest ones shrink into small interactive thumbnails. They stay visible and clickable without cluttering the layout
- **One-click Restore**: Click any miniature to bring it back to full size. The previously focused window becomes the new miniature seamlessly
- **Overview Integration**: Miniatures maintain their scale and position when entering or leaving the GNOME Overview

### Overflow & Workspaces
- **Intelligent Overflow**: Windows that can't be miniaturized (e.g. they hit minimum size) are moved to existing workspaces when possible, or create new ones
- **Fullscreen Support**: Fullscreen and maximized windows automatically get dedicated workspaces
- **Reverse Smart Resize**: When windows close or are miniaturized, remaining windows expand back toward their preferred sizes

### Animations & Polish
- **Directional Momentum**: Windows slide in from the direction they came from, with a bouncy animation
- **Smooth Transitions**: All layout changes are animated for a polished feel
- **Visual Feedback**: Live preview during drag operations shows where windows will land

### Other
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Swap windows with keyboard (configurable)
- **Multi-Monitor**: Works across multiple displays (experimental)

### Quick Settings
- **Per-Workspace Toggle**: Enable or disable mosaic on individual workspaces from the Quick Settings menu
- **Global Toggle**: Master switch to quickly enable/disable mosaic on all workspaces
- **Dynamic Indicator**: Top bar icon shows mosaic status for the current workspace

## Installation

### From Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM.git
cd MosaicWM

# Install the extension
./scripts/build.sh -i

# Log out and log back in, then enable
gnome-extensions enable mosaicwm@cleomenezesjr.github.io
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub
2. Extract to `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/mosaicwm@cleomenezesjr.github.io/`
3. **Disable debug logging**: Edit `extension/logger.js` and set `const DEBUG = false;`
4. Restart GNOME Shell (log out and log back in)
5. Enable via Extensions app or: `gnome-extensions enable mosaicwm@cleomenezesjr.github.io`

## Usage

Once enabled, the extension works automatically:

- **Open windows**: They'll be automatically tiled
- **Drag windows**: Click and drag to reorder
- **Maximize/Fullscreen**: Window moves to its own workspace
- **Minimize**: Window is excluded from tiling
- **Too many windows**: Extra windows shrink into small thumbnails. Click one to bring it back to focus

### Prerequisites

- GNOME Shell 50+
- Git

### Building & Testing

```bash
# Install the extension
./scripts/build.sh -i

# Test in a nested GNOME Shell session
./scripts/run-gnome-shell.sh
```

### Enable Debug Logging

Debug logging is enabled by default for development. To enable verbose debug logs, edit `extension/logger.js` and set:

```javascript
const DEBUG = true;
```

> [!TIP]
> For production/installation, set `DEBUG = false` to reduce CPU usage.

### Debugging

For debugging and development tips, see the [GJS Extension Development Guide](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/debugging.html).

View logs in real-time:

```bash
# Monitor extension logs
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep -i mosaic

# Or use GNOME's Looking Glass (Alt+F2 → 'lg')
# Navigate to Extensions tab to see errors
```

### Code Style

- **Functions**: camelCase (`tileWorkspaceWindows`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`WindowDescriptor`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_CASE (`WINDOW_SPACING`)
- **Private properties**: Prefix with `_` (`this._wmEventIds`)
- **Comments**: Use `//` for inline comments, avoid JSDoc blocks

### Technical Notes

This extension is designed for Wayland sessions and leverages modern compositor integration for proper window positioning and multi-monitor support.

## Known Issues

**Current limitations:**

- Multi-monitor requires **"Workspaces on all displays"** setting (Settings → Multitasking). "Workspaces on primary display only" is not yet supported. ([#30](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM/issues/30))
- Overview drag-drop may have issues in some scenarios
- Edge tiling overflow preview not yet animated
